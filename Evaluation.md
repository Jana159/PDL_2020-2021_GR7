**_Extractor success rate_**
We used the BenchTest.java test with the list of 316 urls presented in largeUrl.test.
We got 1710 csv files for HTML tables and 36 for wikitext tables.
not being able to manually verify all these files, 
we decided according to the pareto law to process 20% of these data.
